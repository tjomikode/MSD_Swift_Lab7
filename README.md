Challenges and issues I could not solve:
    1. TableView skeleton is visible as ActivityIndicator is spinning. 
    2. I did not understand the way threads work in Swift, e.g. shared.dataTask, Dispatch.main.async. Could you recommend some nice sources to read about it in order to fully understand the technology of it?
    3. There is lots of time needed (up to about 10-15 seconds) to fetch images from Pixabay API. Maybe I have to fetch an each image separately somehow? Could you me?

Please, feel free to leave all possible comments & suggestions & advices & helps :) Thanks :)
